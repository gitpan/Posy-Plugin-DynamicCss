=head1 NAME

Posy::Plugin::DynamicCss - Posy plugin to load different CSS styles based on the UserAgent.

=head1 VERSION

This describes version B<0.40> of Posy::Plugin::DynamicCss.

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.40';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    @plugins = qw(Posy::Core
	Posy::Plugin::YamlConfig
	...
	Posy::Plugin::DynamicCss
	...
	));
    @actions = qw(init_params
	    ...
	    head_template
	    dynamic_css_set
	    head_render
	    ...
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin enables Posy users to load different CSS stylesheets
based on the UserAgent.

There is one variable filled in by this plugin that can be used within your
flavour files.  The $flow_dynamic_css_line variable contains the stylesheet
link metatag for the currently selected (browser-specific) CSS file.  This
variable must be inserted into your head flavour file.

=head2 Activation

This plugin needs to be added to both the plugins list and the actions
list.  It doesn't really matter where it is in the plugins list,
just so long as you also have the Posy::Plugin::YamlConfig plugin
as well.

In the actions list, 'dynamic_css_set' needs to go somewhere after
B<head_template> and before B<head_render>, since the config needs to have been
read, and this needs to set values before the head is rendered.

=head2 Configuration

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash,
which, in the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config"
file in the data directory.

This requires the Posy::Plugin::YamlConfig plugin (or equivalent), because the
configuration variables for this plugin are not simple string values; it
expects the config values to be in a hash at $self->{config}->{dynamic_css}

=over 

=item B<dynamic_css>

A hash containing the settings.

=over

=item B<csspath>

Path to the subdirectory where you keep CSS files.

=item B<default>

The default CSS file to use when one can't figure out the browser.

=item B<files>

A hash containing, for each browser, the browser string to compare against,
and the CSS file to use if it matches.

Example config file:

	---
	dynamic_css:
	  csspath: '/styles'
	  default: 'layout_netscape.css'
	  files:
	    gecko: 'layout_gecko.css'
	    'MSIE.6|MSIE.5': 'layout_msie.css'
	    'Mozilla.4' : 'layout_netscape.css'

    my $cssline = '';
    my $done = 0;
    my $default_file = $self->{config}->{dynamic_css}->{default};
 
    while (my ($regex, $file) = each
    %{$self->{config}->{dynamic_css}->{files}}) {
	if ($user =~ /$regex/i) {
	    $cssline = "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" 
                              href=\"$fullpath\/$file\" //>";
	    $done = 1;
	    last;
