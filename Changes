Revision history for Posy-Plugin-DynamicCss
===========================================

0.42 Thu 12 May 2005
--------------------

  * (12 May 2005) update Posy version

  * (12 May 2005) add Makefile.PL

0.41 Sun 06 February 2005
-------------------------

  * (6 Feb 2005) added INSTALL docs

  * (5 Feb 2005) removed Makefile.PL

  * (5 Feb 2005) removed csspath
  	I decided to put this more in line with Posy::Plugin::ThemeCss
  and require one to simply give the links the the CSS files instead
  of having a "csspath".  This gives greater flexibility.
